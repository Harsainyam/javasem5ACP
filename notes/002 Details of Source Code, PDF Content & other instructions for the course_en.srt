1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:07,000
I know you are super excited to start the journey of spring inside this course, but before we jump

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,510
on to the world of Spring framework, let me share a few important details that will help you to get

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:16,070
maximum benefits from this spring course.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,850
The very first information that I want to share is, like you can see this is the GitHub repository

5
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:27,010
information where I'm maintaining all the source code related to this particular course.

6
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:32,049
And inside this source code you can see there are more than 50 example projects.

7
00:00:32,049 --> 00:00:38,440
The reason why I'm giving so many example projects here is, I should have given a single project which

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:44,470
has all the source code that we are going to discuss inside this course, but that will be very tedious

9
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:50,860
job for you to understand everything with a single web application project, because inside this course

10
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:56,740
we are going to explore the features of the spring framework and we are going to build a web application

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,420
in a step by step manner.

12
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:05,810
So that's why to make your life easy, I have created a separate MAVEN project for each and every step

13
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:12,680
that we are going to take while building a web application or while discussing the spring related important

14
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,340
features.

15
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,220
And you can always understand what exactly we have implemented inside that particular example by looking

16
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,660
at the GitHub comments against that particular example project.

17
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,920
Like you can see here under example 4 project, we are going to implement primary annotation inside

18
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:34,880
our code, but before that I'll make sure I'm sharing enough details.

19
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,560
What is the purpose of primary annotation and how to write a sample code around that?

20
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,680
And all these examples, they are enhanced in a sequential manner, like whatever code that you see

21
00:01:45,710 --> 00:01:50,540
inside example for the same code will be present inside the example 5 as well.

22
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:58,100
The only difference between example five and example four is, this example five will have more code related

23
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:00,860
to the feature of spring that we have discussed.

24
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,660
Like inside Example five.

25
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:07,850
I'll be showing you how to create a bean with the help of @Component annotation.

26
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:14,360
So this way all these examples, those are enhanced in a step by step manner and you can see we have

27
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,120
more than 50 projects and against each of these project I have mentioned what exactly we are going to

28
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,360
implement inside that particular example project.

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,770
So here I'm mentioning types of auto wiring and the purpose of qualifier annotation.

30
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:32,780
And here we are going to build an Hello World web app using Thymeleaf and DevTools demo.

31
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:38,630
And similarly, you can also look at this example 26, where I'll be providing an introduction to spring

32
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,740
security and how to configure spring security inside an web application.

33
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,530
So similarly, we have many other example projects, so that's why please travel along with me.

34
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:54,290
Like whenever I am creating a new web application, you don't have to create a new web application again.

35
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,550
Instead, you can keep updating the single web application that you have.

36
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:04,880
That way, it will be very easy for you to enhance your web application in a step by step manner.

37
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:11,480
But I'm giving so many examples of web applications just for your convenience, because using this example

38
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,430
projects, you can always compare,

39
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,150
what's the difference between example 34 and example 35.

40
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,660
That way you can identify the list of changes that I have made in order to achieve the functionality

41
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,160
that I'm highlighted here.

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:28,820
Like to migrate from JDBC template to spring data JPA.

43
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:35,090
So what I have done, what exactly I have done, you can always identify that by comparing the two example

44
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,150
projects like example 34 and example 35.

45
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,660
And the next important information that I want to share here is, I am going to discuss a lot of PowerPoint

46
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:48,080
slides like there are more than 200 PowerPoint slides.

47
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,040
So inside these slides I'll be discussing a lot of theory discussion.

48
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,150
I'll be having some screenshots, how to make certain code configurations.

49
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,670
What is the purpose of a particular annotation?

50
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:03,050
What is an internal flow architecture of a particular component inside spring framework?

51
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,400
So this PowerPoint slide I'm going to share as a PDF version to you.

52
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,280
So that way you don't have to take the notes while you are trying to understand the topic that I'm discussing.

53
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,800
So that's why don't worry about taking notes.

54
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,740
All the details that I'm going to discuss inside this course.

55
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,080
They are available inside the PDF file that I'm going to share inside this course.

56
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,710
So the same pdf file I have attached to this video.

57
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:32,060
So please go ahead and download the PDF and have that as a reference,

58
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,120
whenever you are looking at a particular lecture.

59
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:41,360
That way you can always try to correlate and you can also use the same pdf file to brush up the topics

60
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,890
that we have discussed inside this course, even after six months or even after one year.

61
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:51,800
And whenever you look at this PDF file, it will be very easy for you to understand or to grasp the

62
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,890
topics or to brush up the topics again.

63
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,540
And this will be a savior whenever you are trying to attend an interview on spring.

64
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,050
So in order

65
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:03,870
to download this PDF content, you can see under this lecture 2

66
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,080
there is an resources link and when you click on this resources link you will have an option to

67
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:13,110
download the file with the name spring.pdf.

68
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,340
So my request is,

69
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,870
please download this pdf.

70
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,760
Try to avoid taking notes.

71
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,830
Please completely concentrate on the course and of course if there is some unique approach that you

72
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,100
follow in taking notes, I would encourage you to continue that.

73
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,140
But please have this as a reference.

74
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:33,990
That way you are not trying to duplicate the effort or you are not trying to duplicate the information

75
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:35,640
in multiple places.

76
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:41,550
And the third important information that I want to share here is I have built this course by by assuming

77
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,340
you have zero knowledge on spring framework.

78
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:49,620
So due to that reason, I have provided a lot, many details at many places.

79
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:56,400
But for some reason, if you feel like you already know about a particular topic, you are free to skip

80
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,510
that particular lecture.

81
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:59,730
That way you won't feel get bored.

82
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:05,500
So that's why whenever you are trying to start a lecture first, try to understand if you already aware

83
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,610
of this particular concept that I'm going to discuss inside that lecture.

84
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:16,210
If yes, feel free to skip or you can fast forward very quickly that that way you also brush up the

85
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:22,030
concept very quickly while I'm discussing the same inside the lecture and inside this Section one and

86
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,200
Section two, I'm going to talk very detail about the spring framework.

87
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,430
What is the purpose of it?

88
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:29,470
Why should we use frameworks at all?

89
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,390
What are the spring core concepts?

90
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:37,690
That's why these first two courses are like entirely theory, but the actual coding implementations

91
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:42,760
will start from the section three, like, right, from how to create a bin inside the spring framework.

92
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,250
And from there we are going to build a web application with all the spring projects and with all

93
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:51,190
the features that we are going to discuss inside this course.

94
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:57,850
And the next information that I want to share is about the video quality and the pace of my communication.

95
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:04,690
For some reason, if you feel the quality of the video is not good, please make sure that you are going

96
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:13,870
to the settings option and make sure you are selecting at least 720P or 1080P option if it is available

97
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,930
because by default Udemy is going to change your quality of the video based upon your network speed.

98
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:26,800
So that's why always try to select an option of highest quality that you see inside the video.

99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,560
That way the quality of the video will always stick to whatever quality that you have selected.

100
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,590
And at the same time, for some reason, if you feel like I'm talking too fast and I'm talking too slow,

101
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:42,280
Udemy also have an option of playback rate here.

102
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:48,160
If you feel like I'm talking too slow, you can go with an option of increasing the pace of my communication

103
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,050
like 1.25 x or 1.5 x based upon your comfort levels.

104
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:58,810
And if you feel like I'm talking too fast, then in that scenario you also have an option of slowing

105
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:04,090
my communication by taking an option of 0.75 x or 0.5 x.

106
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:10,840
So please try to select one of the option whatever comfortable for you because these are the universal

107
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,460
problems inside the Udemy.

108
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:18,460
Since inside the Udemy, the courses are going to be taken by students across the world.

109
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:23,440
Definitely there will be a gap in understanding the English language that we talk.

110
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,090
There will be a slang difference.

111
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,790
So that's why always feel free to select the playback rate that that is comfortable to you.

112
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:36,760
And throughout this course, at any point of time, if you have any question or if you stuck with any

113
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,820
issue, I will advise you to follow three steps.

114
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,480
The very first step is first, try to Google for the issue that you are facing, like take help from

115
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,100
the Google and StackOverflow and the developer community that we have that way.

116
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:57,250
In the process, you will also learn how to look for the solutions that you face inside the real world

117
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:57,940
projects.

118
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:03,490
And even after looking the information inside the Google and StackOverflow, you are not able to resolve

119
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:04,150
the issue.

120
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:10,570
Then look at the Q&A section of this course where many students might have posted many questions.

121
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:16,210
And if you look at those questions and answers that I'm mentioning, you can try to correlate if that

122
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:23,080
issue is related to you, if not as a last step, you can always post the question that you have to

123
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:28,780
me through the Q&A section that we have here, or if you feel like you want to send a personal message

124
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:35,530
to me, you can always send a message to me inside Udemy and it will directly come to my Udemy inbox

125
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,470
and I'll try to respond to you as soon as possible.

126
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:45,490
And at last I also want to highlight you that Udemy will ask you for your review at an early stage of

127
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:50,650
the course, and if you feel like you are not yet ready to provide a review, feel free to skip the

128
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,700
review process.

129
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:58,960
And I would always advise you to watch at least 30% of the lectures inside the course and that way you

130
00:09:58,960 --> 00:09:59,590
will be in a good.

131
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,920
Positioned to provide a review to the course.

132
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,280
So with this, I'm super excited to start the journey of the spring along with you.

133
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,000
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture bye.
