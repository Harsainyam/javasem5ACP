1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:06,860
Let's start our discussion by having a brief introduction about what is a spring framework. 

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:10,620
That way you have some basic understanding.

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,970
What is spring and why we have to learn and why everyone in the software industry, especially inside

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:21,470
the Java ecosystem, is using spring to a great extent.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:28,040
So if you really ask me what is a spring, the spring framework, which we can shortly refer it as a

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:36,230
spring, is a mature, powerful and highly flexible Java framework focused on building web applications

7
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:38,120
inside Java ecosystem.

8
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:44,570
The reason why I'm saying it's a mature and powerful framework is, it is not something which got introduced

9
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,600
recently.

10
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:52,640
Spring Framework initially introduced around two decades back, which is in the year of 2002.

11
00:00:52,640 --> 00:01:00,420
From 2002, spring evolved a lot based upon the market trends and based upon the developer needs inside

12
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:01,530
Java ecosystem.

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,970
That's why we can confidently call Spring Framework is a matured and powerful and flexible framework

14
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,220
to build Java web applications.

15
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:18,210
So what makes Spring Framework as a favorite framework for all the Java developers is it will make developer

16
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:27,060
life easy by allowing quicker and easier ways to build web applications, focusing on speed, simplicity

17
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:34,620
and productivity, which are all contributed to make Spring as a world most popular Java framework.

18
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:40,170
On a day to day basis, we as a developers have to focus a lot on business logic.

19
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,220
So considering that as a developer, I should not put lot of efforts in doing configurations, in writing

20
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,950
some dependencies that my application is needed, I should be free from all those requirements.

21
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:59,070
The reason is, as a developer and as a human being, I should focus on the business logic and I should

22
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:06,060
have some easier mechanisms to support all the requirements that I need for a Java Web applications

23
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,259
in the form of defining dependencies, writing configurations.

24
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,010
So all these supporting components is provided by spring in a quicker and easier manner.

25
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,990
We will discuss in the coming lectures.

26
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:26,490
For now, please make a note that spring makes your programming of Java web applications quicker and

27
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:32,820
easier, and the scenario can be anything whether you might be building a web application or reactive

28
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:39,510
application or even a microservices or a backend for a mobile application or you want to build a

29
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:43,860
complex application which will stream data over your enterprise.

30
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,400
So for all these kind of scenarios, Spring has supporting tools that can help during development.

31
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,420
And spring is born as an alternative to the EJBs that are very famous in the early 2000.

32
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:04,860
So we all know Enterprise Java Beans, which is invented as part of Java Enterprise Edition, is

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:06,360
very complex in nature.

34
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,930
So if you ask any of your colleagues who worked on Ejbs around 2000, they can clearly tell you that,

35
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,370
EJB is a super  complicated framework to build web applications.

36
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:24,840
So to avoid all those complications and to make developer life easy, spring came as an alternative

37
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,510
to the EJBs framework, and within no time spring overtook all its opponents.

38
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:37,170
Just because it is very simple to build web applications and it has variety of features and third party

39
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:40,680
library integrations that we can see in the coming lectures.

40
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,970
So with all these features that spring provides, it overtook all its opponents like Ejbs, struts.

41
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,330
So all these frameworks are now behind the spring and spring is majorly being used over the Java ecosystem,

42
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:01,950
and it is so popular that its main competitor, which is Oracle Java Enterprise Edition, they quit

43
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:08,010
their race and they hand over that enterprise edition to the community after Java Enterprise Edition

44
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,400
eight to version just because everyone started and continued to use Spring as their favorite Java framework.

45
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,959
And that's why Oracle felt that there is no meaning putting efforts building Enterprise Edition in competing

46
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:22,950
spring framework.

47
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:29,490
With all these reasons and their own business reasons, Oracle handover that enterprise edition maintenance

48
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,570
to a community.

49
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:36,420
And that's why the recent versions of Enterprise Edition we should call Jakarta Enterprise Edition,

50
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:41,610
but not Java Enterprise Edition, because Oracle owns the brand name of Java.

51
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:47,670
So due to that reason, they renamed that Java Enterprise edition to Jakarta Enterprise Edition.

52
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:52,080
So Jakarta Enterprise Edition maintains by a community of developers.

53
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,520
So you can ask me what is the main reason that Spring framework is so successful?

54
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:59,520
I would say the very first and main reason is.

55
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:04,790
It evolves over the period based upon the market trends, like in the initial days.

56
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,710
Spring came up with only spring core and spring MVC pattern to build monolithic applications.

57
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,270
Later on when industry is moving towards a microservices cloud native applications.

58
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:23,230
Then spring also started evolving by introducing lot of features like Spring Boot, which will make

59
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:27,880
developer life very easy in building web applications, microservices applications.

60
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,970
So with the reasons that it evolves on day to day basis and it's very simple to use and it will make

61
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,440
developer life easy.

62
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:41,800
Spring became one of the most popular Java framework On top of that, Spring is not a commercial framework.

63
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,240
It's an open source.

64
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:47,140
Anyone can use this spring framework without paying any money.

65
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:53,800
So who don't want the open source framework that is providing all the production ready enterprise features?

66
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:00,400
That's why industry adopted this spring framework in a very fast manner and due to this reason over

67
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:07,160
the last few decades, Spring has a large and active community of developers who continuously give feedback

68
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,480
to the spring team and they also provide help to other developers or StackOverflow or writing many blogs

69
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,260
over the web.

70
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:21,920
That way, if any developer struck due to any issues, they can always reach out to these active community

71
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,990
and get help immediately.

72
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:29,120
You can also see how popular the spring framework is inside Java ecosystem.

73
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:37,820
So in 2021, when J Rebel team, they did a survey with all the Java developers with a question that

74
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:44,990
what is the framework that you use inside your projects on day to day basis, you can see 62% of the

75
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:52,160
developers said they are using Spring boot or spring related frameworks, followed by Dropwizard, Quarkus,

76
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:56,000
Micronaut, Vertex and other is 17%.

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:02,690
So inside others we may have many other frameworks, but you can see spring is a clearly a winner here.

78
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:08,840
And similarly, one more survey that is done by snic.io website here.

79
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:14,960
They went ahead and asked all the Java developers to provide what are the frameworks that they use and

80
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,820
they can select more than one response.

81
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:22,220
That's why you can see the sum of all these percentages not matching with 100%.

82
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:28,580
The reason is the developers can select more than one response, but still you can see Spring Boot has

83
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,640
50%, Spring MVC has 31%.

84
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:38,570
So with this, please be super confident that you are learning a hot and trending Java framework, which

85
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:44,660
is spring and as and when we discuss about it features in the coming lectures, I'm definitely confident

86
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,320
that you will also start liking the spring framework with this.

87
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:54,290
I'm hoping you got a brief introduction of what is spring, but don't worry if any of the statements

88
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,480
that I made is not clear to you.

89
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:03,020
The reason is we will discuss each and every feature of spring in the coming lectures in detail.

90
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:09,230
And when we start discussing all those features, I'm sure you will also like and agree with my statements

91
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,440
that spring is a most popular Java framework.

92
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,080
Thank you and I'll see you in the next lecture bye.
