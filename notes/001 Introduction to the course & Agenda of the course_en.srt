00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,070
Welcome to the in detail course on Spring, Spring Boot, JPA and Hibernate. Inside Java Ecosystem 

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:11,360
These are the mostly used and mostly appreciated frameworks.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:18,830
You can't imagine an application or an project or an interview without talking about these frameworks.

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:24,830
So that's why if you want to become a successful Java developer, understanding and mastering these

5
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:31,400
frameworks is very important and this course is going to help you to master these frameworks by talking

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,400
and discussing about each and every concepts that we have inside the spring and associated ecosystem

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,090
projects.

8
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:44,690
So spring, right from day one when it was introduced in 2004, it is keep on changing based upon the  

9
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:45,950
developer needs.

10
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:51,290
So since it is evolving a lot based upon the developer community and the latest trends.

11
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:57,800
So from last two decades, the spring framework became very popular and it is super successful.

12
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:04,500
That's why everyone inside the Java developer community, they are using Spring as a framework inside

13
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,880
their web applications.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:11,400
If you want to build a full stack web application or if you want to build a plain back end system,

15
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:17,490
or if you want to build microservices wherever you go, you can find at least one of the project of

16
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:21,000
Spring framework is being used inside those web applications.

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:26,400
So with all these reasons, it's very important to understand and master the spring framework.

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,380
So before you take a decision whether to enroll for this course or not, let me cover you,

19
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,420
what are all the topics and concepts that I'm going to discuss inside this course?

20
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:42,150
Like you can see here, first we are going to start this course by talking about the Spring framework

21
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:42,810
introduction.

22
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:43,560
What is spring?

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,280
How it is different from the Java Enterprise Edition framework and how spring evolved over last two

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:50,670
decades?

25
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:55,980
What is the release timeline of spring and what are all the different projects that we have inside the

26
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:57,330
spring ecosystem?

27
00:01:57,330 --> 00:02:03,120
Once we are clear about the introduction of the spring framework, we will jump on to the spring core

28
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,840
concepts.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,600
So inside the spring core concepts, we are going to discuss what is an inversion of control, what

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:15,000
is an dependency injection and what are the beans inside the spring framework, how to create them and

31
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,970
how to auto wire them based upon the concepts like inversion of control and dependency injection.

32
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:27,030
And we'll also discussing about aspect oriented programming paradigm, which is available inside the

33
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:27,990
spring framework.

34
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:33,000
And once we are clear about the spring core concepts which we are going to discuss at the starting of

35
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,470
this course, we will jump on to the concept of spring MVC.

36
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:43,350
So when we are discussing about the spring MVC, we'll try to understand what is an MVC pattern, how

37
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:46,110
it is going to help us in building web applications.

38
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,230
So once we are clear about this MVC pattern, we are going to discuss how the spring MVC adopted the

39
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:58,170
MVC pattern and what is the internal architecture of the spring MVC and how it is going to make our

40
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:02,400
lives easy in building web applications with the help of MVC Pattern.

41
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,580
And when we are discussing about spring MVC, we'll also talk about how to perform validations on your

42
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,840
UI forms,

43
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,100
HTML forms.

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,350
That way, the bad data entered by your end user will not come into your database.

45
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:22,140
So once we are clear about the spring MVC concept, we will straight away jump on to the Thymeleaf.

46
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,100
So Thymeleaf will allow us to build dynamic web applications by integrating both Thymeleaf and spring

47
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,060
projects like Spring MVC, Spring Core and Spring Security.

48
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:39,630
So by adopting both Spring framework and Thymeleaf libraries, we are going to build a dynamic web application

49
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:46,410
inside this course, and I'll be showing a sample glimpse of that dynamic web application in few minutes.

50
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,640
After Thymeleaf.

51
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,950
We are going to spend a good amount of time understanding what is Spring boot, how it is different

52
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:58,650
from Spring MVC, Spring core, why everyone these days loving spring boot, whether they are going

53
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:02,100
to build a web applications or rest service or microservices.

54
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:05,040
Why everyone is adopting spring boot these days.

55
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,210
So all those kind of discussion we are going to do under the section of Spring Boot.

56
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:14,460
And once we are clear about the Spring Boot project, we are also going to discuss the concepts of spring

57
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,980
boot like auto configuration, how to build web application with the help of Spring Boot, Thymeleaf, Spring

58
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,490
MVC.

59
00:04:20,670 --> 00:04:22,110
What is Spring Boot DevTools?

60
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:24,090
What is Spring Boot H2 database?

61
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:28,260
So all these are the beautiful concepts that are available inside the spring boot.

62
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:33,240
So we are going to spend a good amount of time understanding the spring boot, because Spring Boot is

63
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,570
a heart framework or project inside the spring ecosystem.

64
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:43,260
After spring boot, we are going to learn how to secure our web application or rest APIs with the help

65
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:47,520
of spring security framework available inside the spring ecosystem.

66
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,640
So with the help of spring security, we will learn how to implement authentication and authorization

67
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:57,300
role based access inside the web applications.

68
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,790
And along with that, we'll also learn how we.

69
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:06,670
Can leverage spring security to protect our Web application from the most common security vulnerabilities

70
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:11,420
like cross-site request forgery and cross-origin resource sharing.

71
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,800
After spring security, we will jump on to the projects and frameworks related to the persistent layer.

72
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,440
So inside the persistent layer, we are going to write a lot of Java code in order to interact with

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,430
the databases.

74
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,860
So that's where we will try to understand what is spring JDBC, how it is different from the core Java

75
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,520
JDBC, how the spring JDBC is going to make our lives easy with the help of JDBC templates available

76
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,590
inside the spring JDBC project.

77
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:45,730
After spring JDBC, we are going to discuss what is an ORM frameworks, how frameworks are better than

78
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,650
spring JDBC, how we can write a persistent code with the help of warm frameworks.

79
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:55,330
Why everyone is loving warm frameworks like Hibernate Spring Data, JPA these days.

80
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,310
So inside this course we are going to spend a good amount of time understanding all the warm framework

81
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:06,640
concepts and how to build a web applications with very less code of persistent logic where we don't

82
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:12,400
have to write a lot of SQL queries, we can rely completely on the ORM frameworks to perform some CRUD

83
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,550
operations onto the database and inside the spring data.

84
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:21,730
We'll also discuss about the advanced concepts like different mappings that we have inside ORM frameworks

85
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:28,420
like 1 to 1, one to many, many to one, many to many that are available inside Spring Data, JPA and

86
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,200
Hibernate.

87
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:35,620
And when we are discussing about spring data and spring Data JPA, we are going to build our web application

88
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:41,680
with the help of ORM framework like Spring Data JPA and internally this spring data JPA is going

89
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,950
to leverage Hibernate as an implementation framework.

90
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,560
So that's why we are going to discuss all the concepts that are common to the ORM frameworks like Spring

91
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,440
Data  JPA and Hibernate inside this course.

92
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:58,660
And once we are clear about these advanced concepts, we'll also discuss about how to sort the data,

93
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:05,500
how to do pagination and how to write queries with the help of JPQL format inside the web applications.

94
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:10,390
So all these advanced topics that are going to make our lives super easy as a developers.

95
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:16,060
So that's why I'm going to spend a good amount of time making you understanding about these advanced

96
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:21,400
concepts and advanced  ORM frameworks that we have inside the spring ecosystem.

97
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,980
And of course hibernate is a separate framework.

98
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:30,100
But as long as you are learning about spring data JPA and the concepts around the ORM frameworks,

99
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:35,560
both Spring Data JPA and Hibernate, they are going to work in a very similar manner.

100
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,030
Like I was telling before, whenever you are trying to build a web application with the help of Spring

101
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:47,440
Data JPA, internally your spring data JPA is going to leverage Hibernate framework as an implementation.

102
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:54,340
So that's why I want to highlight that we are not going to discuss spring data JPA and Hibernate separately.

103
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:58,390
We are going to discuss them as a common ORM framework.

104
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:04,720
Like if I'm explaining a concept like one to 1 or 1 to many that are applicable to ORM frameworks,

105
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,220
the same concept is applicable for both Spring data JPA and Hibernate.

106
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,130
And once we are clear about the spring data and spring Data JPA framework, we are also going to discuss

107
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:20,560
how to build the rest service and how to consume the rest service with the help of Spring Boot and the

108
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,380
concepts that we have inside the spring framework.

109
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,980
In the process, we will also learn how to secure our rest services.

110
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:32,830
And once we discuss all these main projects, we are also going to discuss the miscellaneous concepts

111
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:36,640
that we need to be aware whenever we are building web applications.

112
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,409
And one of the miscellaneous concepts that we are going to focus inside this course is logging.

113
00:08:41,409 --> 00:08:46,030
So whenever we are discussing about logging, I'll be explaining you the importance of logging, what

114
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:49,960
are the different severities and how to control the severities of logging.

115
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:56,470
And in this process I'll explain you how Spring Boot is going to make our life so much easy in terms

116
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,660
of logging inside the web applications.

117
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:05,380
And we'll also discuss how to write our logs into a file that we have defined inside a folder location.

118
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:12,280
After logging, we will also discuss about how to define a property inside a property file and how to

119
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:17,170
read the properties that are available inside a property file from your Java code.

120
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:23,050
And once we are clear about these basic concepts of properties, we are also going to discuss advanced

121
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:26,440
concepts that is available inside the Spring boot, which is profiles.

122
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,490
So using profiles, I'll teach you how we can activate a specific set of properties or a logical group

123
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:37,540
of properties based upon the environment where your application is running.

124
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,820
And I'll also show you how to conditionally create the beans based upon the activated profile.

125
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,520
And once we are clear about these properties and profiles and at last we are going to discuss about

126
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,200
the spring boot actuator.

127
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:56,410
So we'll learn what is spring boot actuator, what are the different APIs or endpoints that are exposed

128
00:09:56,410 --> 00:09:59,770
by the spring boot actuator and how we can leverage this information?

129
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:06,980
Available inside these APIs to understand the health of our web application and to monitor our web application

130
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,050
whenever we deploy our web application into a higher environment like production.

131
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:18,350
Once we discuss all the topics of Spring, Spring Boot and all other remaining framework towards the

132
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:26,240
end of the course, we are also going to deploy the Spring boot web application into the cloud environment.

133
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:32,510
And here I also want to highlight that I have put a lot of efforts in building the content of this course

134
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:38,300
so that you can easily understand all the concepts that we are going to discuss inside this course.

135
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:43,040
Like you can see here, this are all the sample content that I'm going to present.

136
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:50,240
So inside this content I have mentioned all the notes and sample code screenshots that you may need

137
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,000
whenever you want to brush up all these concepts in the future, even after one year or two years.

138
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:02,550
That way this content, you can always refer them whenever you have some questions or whenever you are

139
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:03,900
going for an interview.

140
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:10,170
You can always use this as a quick material to brush up your skills on the spring framework. And all

141
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:17,400
the complex topics inside the spring framework are presented in an easily understandable format.

142
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,480
So I'm going to share all this content in a PDF format to you.

143
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,660
That way you don't have to worry about taking notes.

144
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,610
You can simply focus on the course.

145
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:32,520
And apart from discussing about the theory inside this course, we are also going to implement a web

146
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:37,740
application by leveraging all the concepts that we are going to learn inside this course.

147
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:43,380
So let me show you the sample glimpse of the web application that we are going to build by the end of

148
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,160
this course.

149
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,540
Like you can see here, this is the sample web application that we are going to build.

150
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,920
So this web application is based upon the school functionality.

151
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,560
The reason why I have chose the school functionality is, school is a concept or a functionality which

152
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,110
is very close to our hearts and no one need a special knowledge to understand the functionality or the

153
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:06,720
logistics that we have around the school.

154
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,510
So that's why I have choose this school functionality.

155
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:15,120
And inside this school web application, we are going to build all the dynamic web pages with the help

156
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,200
of spring framework.

157
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:23,370
Like this is a home page and we'll also have many HTML form pages where we can enter the data inside

158
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,600
our web application.

159
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:30,570
And during this process, we'll also validate the data that is entered by my end user with the help

160
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,710
of validations concepts that are available inside the spring framework.

161
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:41,970
And apart from saving the data from the HTML forms, we'll also display the data from the back end onto

162
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,120
our easy School web application that we are going to build.

163
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,160
Like you can see here, all these all this information is coming from the back end database.

164
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:56,160
So with the help of Spring framework, I'll be showing how to load the data from the database and how

165
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:00,210
to send that to an UI web application and how to display that.

166
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:04,170
So all those kind of end to end concepts we are going to discuss.

167
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:08,160
And also we'll be having a login page and using this login page.

168
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,430
I'm going to secure my web application that way,

169
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:16,260
only authenticated and authorized users will access my web application.

170
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:22,290
So if I try to log in with my admin credentials, you can see there are many links that will be available

171
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:29,070
inside the dashboard where by clicking on these links my admin can see the data and he can perform many

172
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,200
actions on this web application.

173
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:36,990
So this way we are going to implement security inside our web application with the help of spring security

174
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:43,770
and we'll also implement role based access inside our web application and all the data that we are going

175
00:13:43,770 --> 00:13:49,950
to save and fetch and display onto this web page will be handled with the help of frameworks like Spring

176
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:56,220
Data JPA, Spring JDBC and ORM frameworks that we are going to discuss inside this course.

177
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:00,420
I hope you are clear about what we are going to discuss inside this course.

178
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:05,910
So if you are looking to master the spring framework and its associated projects like Spring Boot, Spring

179
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:12,960
Data JPA, then definitely please go ahead and register to this course without any thought and I'm sure

180
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:17,670
that you will like this course based upon the content that we are going to discuss.

181
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:23,130
And like I said, I'm going to share the all the PDF content that I'm going to present inside this course.

182
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:28,920
And along with that, I'm also going to share you the source code of this web application, which I'm

183
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,020
maintaining inside a GitHub repository.

184
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:34,170
So with this I'm hoping you to see in the next lecture.

185
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,520
Thank you and bye.
